    "To start off with, we shall return to the simple linear regression output. Notice that there is an $F$-statistic given at the bottom for the model as a whole ... Notice that this $p$-value is *identical* to the $p$-value for the slope coefficient. What's more, the $F$-statistic value is actually equivalent to the *square* of the $t$-statistic. In other words, the test on whether the coefficient is 0 in the population and the test of the model against a model containing only an intercept are *the exact same test*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually quite a deep insight and tells us something very interesting about the fact that we can conceptualise testing coefficients in a model as a *model comparison procedure*.\n",
